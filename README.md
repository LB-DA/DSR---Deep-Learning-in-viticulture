# A DSR-Study on Deep Learning Systems in Viticulture

### In this repository you will find the documented Python script as a Jupyter notebook file.
### This script applies an OD model to a video and performs object tracking, object counting, and missing object identification for vines. In addition, the output is presented as an interactive map, showing the location of the vineyard and the locations of missing vines with exact GPS positions.
### This script requires a video file with appropriate GPS-information as input. As an example please see the directory "videos"

### Under exemplary models you will find an exemplary model that can be used to perform object recognition. however, you need a working tensor flow object recognition environment to run the model. the label map of the model should be the same as the one specified (see directory of exemplary models).
