# A DSR-Study on Deep Learning Systems in Viticulture

### In this repository you will find the documented python script "DL-system_viticulture" as a Jupyter Notebook-file.
### This script applies an OD model on a video and performs object tracking, object counting, and missing object identification for vines. In addition, the output is presented as an interactive map, showing the location of the vineyard and the locations of missing vines with exact GPS positions.

### It is recommended to download the file and open it with Jupyter Notebook to get the correct documentation format. The preview version of github can be shifted due to the limited width.

### This script requires a video file with appropriate GPS information as input. As an example for such GPS information please refer to the directory "gps_information_sample".

### The directory "gps_output_backup" contains sample outputs of the script "DL-system_viticulture"
