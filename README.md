# A DSR-Study on Deep Learning Systems in Viticulture

## in this repository you will find the documented Python script as a Jupyter notebook file. This script applies an OD model to a video and performs object tracking, object counting, and missing object identification for vines. In addition, the output is presented as an interactive map, showing the location of the vineyard and the locations of missing vines with exact GPS positions.
